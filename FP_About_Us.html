        We grouped together to develop this organization because we wanted to give other people the resources to engage in social good and serve those around them.
        We believe that combining coding with volunteering will create a greater community.</h4>

    <h3>Megan Sng</h3>
    <p>My name is Megan Sng, a rising senior at The Taft School. I was so lucky to be able to be part of this group, along with two other girls who are so passionate about using code to change the world. Community service has always been important to me and my family and I have been fortunate enough to have travelled to various countries to serve those who need it the most. I am really excited about encouraging others to serve others, and reading about their exciting and experiences!

    <h3>Catherine Fang</h3>
    <p>My name is Catherine Fang, and I am a senior at Carnegie Vanguard High School. I love volunteering in my community, but sometimes I find it difficult to find the perfect place to work at. This is why we decided to make an open forum for people to discuss their experiences at various locations: it allows others to learn which organizations are best fit for their interests. I firmly believe that by creating a website dedicated to exposing people to the countless ways that they can impact their community, more people will take initiative to serve others.</p>

    <h3>Isabelle Grimesey</h3>
    <p>My name is Isabelle, and I’m excited to present our project for Girls Who Code 2018 Summer Immersion Program. I want to start serving my community, but I don’t know how I can get involved. Keeping track of my service seems like an overwhelming task. I know that if I can solve these issues, then I will be doing community service in no time. That’s why I decided to create this platform, to help people have a more convenient experience when starting. If learning about and keeping track of service can be easy, more people will get involved.</p>
